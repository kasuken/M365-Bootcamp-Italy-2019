# Create custom connectors for Microsoft Flow and PowerApps
You will find the GitHub repository containing all code [here](https://github.com/plamber/powerplattformcustomconnectors).

The repository will be extended with more examples over time. Hence, we recommend to follow it.

There is also a blog series talking documenting the necessary steps and considerations when building a custom connector. You can find it [here](https://www.nubo.eu/How-Do-I-Create-A-Custom-Connector-For-Microsoft-Flow-And-PowerApps/).
